classes:
 - class: Main Streams
   tools:
    - name: MATLAB Data Analysis
      id: mat
      blurb: MATLAB is a powerful and versatile tool for data acquisition, analysis and visualisation. In this workshop, you’ll learn the basics of MATLAB for quick and effective data analysis. It covers all steps from reading in data, writing scripts and functions for basic analyses, and creating figures that can be shared and published.
    - name: R Data Analysis
      id: r
      blurb: R is widely used across a range of disciplines for statistical computing and generating publication-quality figures. In this Software Carpentry workshop, you’ll learn the fundamentals of R for data science, Unix Shell for interacting with other programs, as well as version control and useful concepts for scientific computing such as breaking down problems into modular units, reproducibility, tracking changes to code, collaborating with others, and working with structured data.
    - name: Python (via iPython) Data Analysis
      id: py
      blurb: Python is a powerful, general purpose programming language that has several popular scientific libraries that make it ideal for research. This workshop will equip you with the essential skills you need to use the Python programming language. It covers fundamentals as well as creating reusable functions, graphing with matplotlib and what to do to find and fix errors in your code.
    - name: NLTK Natural Language Processing
      id: nltk
      blurb: Researchers are often confronted with natural language datasets so large that not even teams of researchers would be able to analyse by hand. (Even just reading through the 100 million word British National Corpus, for example, would take around 10,000 hours.) Python's Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) provides a powerful means of investigating large bodies of text for patterns that may otherwise be very difficult to find. In this workshop, you’ll learn key concepts and practices in Corpus Linguistics/Distant Reading, investigate example datasets and strategies for implementing NLTK within your own research.
    - name: AutoDesk Inventor
      id: ad3d
      blurb: Inventor 3D CAD software offers researchers an easy-to-use set of tools for 3D object design, documentation and product simulation. <i>Digital prototyping</i> with Inventor can help researchers design and validate physical concepts before they’re built. Turning ideas to reality with better research outcomes at reduced cost and lead-times. The training aims to teach basic principles in designing parts, assemblies, and drawings.
    - name: 3D Slicer
      id: 3ds
      blurb: 3D Slicer (Slicer) is a free and open source software package for medical image analysis and scientific visualization. Slicer’s platform provides functionalities for segmentation, registration and three-dimensional visualization of multimodal image data, as well as advanced image analysis algorithms for diffusion tensor imaging, functional magnetic resonance imaging and image-guided radiation therapy. The training aims to teach basic principles in image processing, as well as techniques in extracting 3D models for bio-simulations and 3D printing.
